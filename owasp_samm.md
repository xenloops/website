# Using the OWASP SAMM

## What is OWASP?

A quick intro to clear up some misconceptions. OWASP (the Open Worldwide Application Security Program) is an open-source, open community of security practitioners (and anyone interested in securing all the things, really), with lots of projects ranging from application security training and cheat sheets to risk management, and everything between. (If it has to do with AppSec, there's probably an OWASP project for it. Seriously, search the web for "OWASP" and anything AppSec related, and you'll find an OWASP page for it.) 

## What is the OWASP SAMM?

The Software Assurance Maturity Model provides a clearly measurable way for organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture. It contains 90 questions covering the following domains across the secure SDLC:
* Governance
  * Strategy and Metrics
  * Policy and Compliance
  * Education and Guidance
* Design
  * Threat Assessment
  * Security Requirements
  * Security Architecture
* Implementation
  * Secure Build
  * Secure Deployment
  * Defect Management
* Verification
  * Architecture Assessment
  * Requirements-driven Testing
  * Security Testing
* Operations
  * Incident Management
  * Environment Management
  * Operational Management

The model can focus on an individual software or infrastructure project or be applied to the entire organization (relating to secure software). The SAMM team is even working on [community-sourced data for a benchmark](https://owaspsamm.org/benchmark), so orgs can compare their maturity to others (anonymously of course -- as security practitioners, we are concerned with privacy, naturally). 

The model is available in many formats:
* Spreadsheet
* PDF
* On-line surveys (created by various companies)
